# Namingo DNS Server
A simple DNS server written in PHP

This project is an experimental DNS server written in PHP, utilizing the Swoole extension for asynchronous networking. It serves as a simple demonstration of how a DNS server could be implemented in PHP, but is not intended to be a production-ready or fully functional DNS server.

Note: This project was primarily an experiment and will not be continued. However, it's left here as an archived resource if anyone finds it useful or would like to extend and improve upon it.

Future
This project is an archived experiment and will not be actively developed or maintained. It serves as a simple proof of concept for educational purposes. If you are interested in developing it further, feel free to fork and extend it as needed.

Conclusion
This experimental project was an exploration of building a DNS server using PHP and Swoole. While it is not suitable for production use, it could be a fun starting point for those interested in network programming in PHP. Use it at your own risk!

Happy experimenting! ðŸŽ‰
